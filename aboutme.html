    <p> Hi, I’m Vanan! </p>
    
    <p> I am a graduate from UMass Amherst, where I majored in English with a certificate in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/pwtc/" target="_blank"> Professional Writing and Technical Communication </a>, and letters of specialization in <a href="https://www.umass.edu/english/study-and-practice-writing" target="_blank">the Study and Practice of Writing</a>, and <a href="https://www.umass.edu/english/creative-writing-specialization" target="_blank"> Creative Writing</a>.</p>
    
    <p> My goal is to effectively communicate information to various audiences in an efficient and accessible manner. I intend to combine my writing experience, my technical writing skills, and my experience with literature and publishing to create and promote writing that supports a diverse and inclusive community.</p>
    
    <p> During my time at UMass, I was an outreach coordinator at <i> 22nd Literary Journal </i>and worked as a content editor for the UMass Amherst Chapter of <i> Her Campus</i>.</p>
    
    <p> In my free time, I enjoy taking care of my growing collection of succulents and learning how to cook different recipes. I’m also an avid reader, though I think my strong suit rests in buying and admiring new books rather than actually reading them.</p>
