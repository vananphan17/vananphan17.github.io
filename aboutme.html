    <p> Hello! My name is Vanan and I'm passionate about all things that have to do with houseplants. </p>
    
    <p> Since joining the Rose Kennedy Greenway Conservancy in December 2022, I focus mainly on analyzing donor data to create effective fundraising strategies that allow The Greenway to continue implementing programs and activities that are accessible to everyone in and around the Boston area. In addition to helping acquire funds to maintain the park, I also work closely with other departments to ensure we are educating both donors and visitors to the importance of having a green space in the city.</p>
    
    <p> In addition to my work in sustainability and climate change, Iâ€™m extremely passionate about empowering AAPI women through storytelling, professional development, and programming. As a volunteer for the National Association of Asian American Professionals, Boston chapter, I work across various committees to help members share their stories, experiences, and perspectives, as well as organize professional development workshops and community events that will lead to greater opportunities for the next generation and create long lasting impact.</p>
    
    <p> I look forward to connecting with you and learning more about your favorite plants!</p>
